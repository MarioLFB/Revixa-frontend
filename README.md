## Technical Design

### Agile Design

An agile approach was taken in developing this project, utilizing GitHub Projects to track User Stories and prioritize essential functionalities. Labels were used to categorize and guide development focus.

This agile methodology enabled the timely delivery of core functionalities for Revixa, with flexibility for future enhancements.

### CRUD Functionality

Revixa offers full CRUD functionality for user account management:

- **Create**: Users can register and create accounts, post comments on reviews, and give likes to comments. Admins can create new reviews.
- **Read**: Users can view their profile information, browse reviews, read comments, and see which comments they or others have liked.
- **Update**: Users can update their profile details, change their email and password, edit their comments, and toggle likes on other usersâ€™ comments. Admins can edit reviews as necessary.
- **Delete**: Users can remove their comments and unlike previously liked comments. Admins have the ability to delete reviews to maintain platform quality.

### Colours

The Revixa color palette includes shades of orange and white, providing a modern and pleasant visual experience.

### Manual Testing

A detailed manual testing process was conducted to validate the functionality of each user story. See [Testing User Stories](#testing) for more information.

## Bugs

| Bug | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Users able to like their own posts | Restricted users from liking their own posts by conditionally rendering `LikeButton` only for non-authored posts, using `AuthContext` to verify if the current user is the author. Ensures interaction accuracy by disabling self-likes. (Commit: 8294e67b32125b7ae34d9a547d05a1a33285b1a6) |
| Misaligned LikeButton and LikesCount in Post component | Fixed by grouping `LikeButton` and `LikesCount` within `LikeContainer`, improving alignment and spacing. (Commit: 8f55be899d7adb4bbb8a6cb4858f071f1cc0750b) |
| Incorrect navigation behavior of PrimaryButton | Fixed `PrimaryButton` to correctly use `react-router` `Link` for proper navigation behavior. (Commit: 7e79de89f12760a3da4ed935189998f89de285c8) |
| Liking posts with incorrect HTTP method | Changed `likePost` method from `GET` to `POST` for liking posts. (Commit: 2e7502ad2460cfa8450ad112df0038a240ddab40) |
